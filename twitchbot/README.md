Twitch chat logger

This utility captures chat information and dumps it into an sql database for later use. 
The current version also supports rudimentary !commands

Needed files:
logger.py - This is the workhorse
config.json - This file contains your channel information, oAuth key and admin list

Other files:
twitchlog.db - SQlite database. This file is automatically generated the first time the script is run. 
The database contains a single table "chatlog". This table contains the following columns:

id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
message text NOT NULL
channel text NOT NULL
sentts text NOT NULL
userid text NOT NULL
badges text NOT NULL
displayname text NOT NULL
mod text NOT NULL
subscriber text NOT NULL
usertype text NOT NULL

All data points are harvested from the twitch api
    
Requirements:
Python 3.5 or greater
A twitch api key - go to https://dev.twitch.tv/ and create an app
